orz is an optimized ROLZ (reduced offset Lempel-Ziv) general purpose data compressor. input data is encoded as ROLZ-matches (reduced-offsets and match lengths), 2-byte words, and single bytes. then all encoded symbols are processed with a symbol ranking (aka Move-to-Front) transformer and a static huffman coder.

benefited from the ROLZ algorithm, orz compresses times faster than many other LZ-based compressors which has same compression ratio, and decompression speed is still very acceptable.

orz is completely implemented in the crab-lang. clone the repo and run `cargo build --release` to have an executable orz binary.

installation
============
you can install orz with cargo:

    cargo install orz --git https://github.com/richox/orz --tag v1.6.2

usage
=====

for compression:

    orz encode <source-file-input> <compressed-file-output>

for decompression:

    orz decode <compressed-file-input> <source-file-output>

for more details, see `orz --help`
